<!--
Note: If your bug report relates to Docker's swarm mode, please file it against
the Moby repository instead: https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/new

In general, if you experienced a bug using commands that start with `docker`,
the report probably belongs in the Moby repository. The swarmkit repository
should only be used for specific low-level issue reports related to swarmkit's
internals.

That is to say, even if you have tracked the root cause of a problem to
swarmkit, that issue should probably still be filed under moby/moby. This
helps us organize our bug triage.

For more information about reporting issues on the Docker project, see
https://github.com/moby/moby/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#reporting-other-issues
