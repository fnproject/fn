## Documentation

When creating a Pull Request, make sure that you also update the documentation
accordingly.

Most of the times, when making some behavior more explicit or adding a feature,
a documentation update is necessary.

You will either update a file inside docs/ or create one. Prefer the former over
the latter. If you are unsure, do not hesitate in open the PR with a comment
asking for suggestions on how to address the documentation part.

## How to build and get up and running

### Build

The first time after you fork or after dependencies get updated, run:

```sh
make dep
```

Then after every change, run

```sh
make run
```

to build and run the `functions` binary.  It will start Functions using an embedded `sqlite3` database running on port `8080`.

### Test

```sh
make test
```

#### Run in Docker

```sh
make docker-run
```

will start Functions inside a Docker container.

## Tests in Docker

```sh
make docker-test

```

will test Functions inside a Docker container.
