# Writing Functions

This will give you the basic overview of writing base level functions. You can also use higher level
abstractions that make it easier such as [lambda](lambda/README.md).

Also, for complete examples in various languages, see the [examples directory](/examples).

## Code

The most basic code layout in any language is as follows, this is pseudo code and is not meant to run.

```ruby
# Read and parse from STDIN
body = JSON.parse(STDIN)

# Do something
return_struct = doSomething(body)

# If sync, respond:
STDOUT.write(JSON.generate(return_struct))
# If async, update something:
db.update(return_struct)
```

## Inputs

Inputs are provided through standard input and environment variables. We'll just talk about the default input format here, but you can find others [here](function-format.md).
To read in the function body, just read from STDIN.

You will also have access to a set of environment variables.

* `FN_REQUEST_URL` - the full URL for the request ([parsing example](https://github.com/fnproject/fn/tree/master/examples/tutorial/params))
* `FN_APP_NAME` - the name of the application that matched this route, eg: `myapp`
* `FN_PATH` - the matched route, eg: `/hello`
* `FN_METHOD` - the HTTP method for the request, eg: `GET` or `POST`
* `FN_CALL_ID` - a unique ID for each function execution.
* `FN_DEADLINE` - RFC3339 time stamp of the expiration (deadline) date of function execution.
* `FN_FORMAT` - a string representing one of the [function formats](function-format.md), currently either `default` or `http`. Default is `default`.
* `FN_MEMORY` - a number representing the amount of memory available to the call, in MB
* `FN_TYPE` - the type for this call, currently 'sync' or 'async'
* `FN_HEADER_$X` - the HTTP headers that were set for this request. Replace $X with the upper cased name of the header and replace dashes in the header with underscores.
  * `$X` - any [configuration values](https://github.com/fnproject/cli/blob/master/README.md#application-level-configuration) you've set
  for the Application or the Route. Replace X with the upper cased name of the config variable you set. Ex: `minio_secret=secret` will be exposed via MINIO_SECRET env var.
* `FN_PARAM_$Y` - any variables found from parsing the URL. Replace $Y with any `:var` from the url.

Warning: these may change before release.

## Logging

Standard out is where you should write response data for synchronous functions. Standard error
is where you should write for logging, as [it was intended](http://www.jstorimer.com/blogs/workingwithcode/7766119-when-to-use-stderr-instead-of-stdout).

So to write output to logs, simply log to STDERR. Here are some examples in a few languages.

In Go, simply use the [log](https://golang.org/pkg/log/) package, it writes to STDERR by default.

```go
log.Println("hi")
```

In Node.js:

```node
console.error("hi");
```

[More details for Node.js here](http://stackoverflow.com/a/27576486/105562).

In Ruby:

```ruby
STDERR.puts("hi")
```

## Using Lambda Functions

### Lambda everywhere

Lambda support for Fn enables you to take your AWS Lambda functions and run them
anywhere. You should be able to take your code and run them without any changes.

Creating Lambda functions is not much different than using regular functions, just use
the `lambda-node` runtime.

```sh
fn init --runtime lambda-node --name lambda-node
```

Be sure the filename for your main handler is `func.js`.

TODO: Make Java and Python use the new workflow too.
